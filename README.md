# Project Title: [ContentText Summarizer] 

This is a prototype of basic chatbots that aims to create a basic chatbot capable of understanding user intents related to checking account balance, transaction history, as well as 
handling greetings and goodbyes. Throughout the development of this chatbot, I had the opportunity to learn and implement various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Documentation
==================

The key features of the chatbot include:
1> Intent Classification: 
---------------------------
The chatbot is trained to classify user intents, allowing it to distinguish between checking account balance, transaction history, greetings, goodbyes, and other basic intents.

2> Entity Recognition:
-----------------------
 The chatbot utilizes Entity Recognition to identify relevant pieces of information from user inputs, such as account numbers, names, and phone numbers.

3> Slot Management:
---------------------
 Extracted entity values are stored in slots, enabling the chatbot to retain and process the relevant information during the conversation flow.

4> Data Integration: 
---------------------
For this task, a simple dictionary-based database is used to match and verify user-provided values against pre-defined account information.
Personalized Responses: When a user's information matches the stored database, the chatbot generates personalized responses. For example: "Dear {name}, your account {account number} has a balance of Rs. 1000."
