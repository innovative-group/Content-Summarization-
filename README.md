## Documentation
Object Detection & Counting:
----------------------------
It is a simple AI powered Text/Content Summarizer web app developed on Python and Flask.

This web app will generate summary of your entered text in a simple and faster way.
Which will you to get good insight of your content in short time.


imports used:
-----------------------------
1> import spacy,
2> from spacy.lang.en.3> stop_words import STOP_WORDS
4> from string import punctuation
5> from heapq import nlargest
    
Some function you should be aware of 
----------------------------------
    1> .get() 
    2> .get
    3>  nlargest() 

        1> .get(): It is a method: It is a built-in method provided by dictionaries in Python.
                It is used to retrieve the value associated with a specified key in
                the dictionary. The method is called with parentheses and can take
                an optional default value parameter.

        2> .get :  It is an attribute: It refers to the underlying '.get()' method 
                itself without invoking it. It can be accessed without using 
                parentheses, and you can assign it to a variable or pass it as an
                argument to other functions.

        Example: 
        --------
        person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}

        name_1 = person.get('name')
        print(name_1)  # --->  Output: John

        get_method = person.get
        name_2 = get_method('name')
        print(name_2)  # --->  Output: John
    


 nlargest(n, iterable, key)    
        
        The nlargest function from the heapq module is used to retrieve then largest
        elements from a given iterable based on a specified key. The elements are 
        determined to be the largest based on the comparison of the values generated
        by the key function.
            
            n        : The number of largest elements to retrieve.
            iterable : The iterable from which the largest elements will be selected.  
            key      : The key parameter allows you to define a function that will be 
                    applied to each element in the iterable to generate a value for
                    comparison. The nlargest function then selects the n largest 
                    elements based on these generated values.



        First of all lets take/select a length of sentence that how many sentence 
        do we goona generate as summary output and we select sentence from "sent_freq"
        dictionary based on the "key= sent_freq.get"

        nlargest() function with key=sent_freq.get is used to retrieve the sentences
        with the highest frequencies from the sent_freq dictionary. The key parameter
        allows us to specify the values (frequencies) associated with each sentence 
        for comparison to determine the largest sentences.
