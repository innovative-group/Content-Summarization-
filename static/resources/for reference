nlp= spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
doc= nlp(text)

Explanation: 

"nlp= spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')": 
-------------------------------------
It loads the English language model
'en_core_web_sm' provided by spaCy. This model is trained to perform various
natural language processing tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and more.

"doc= nlp(text)": 
-----------------
It processes the text using the loaded language model. It creates a Doc object,
which represents a sequence of tokens with linguistic annotations. The 'text' 
variable containing the input text is passed to the language model for analysis 
and annotation.
